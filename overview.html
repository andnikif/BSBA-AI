                <h2>Overview & Rationale</h2>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>Program Vision</h3>
                    <p>To cultivate business professionals equipped with strong analytics capabilities and an AI-first mindset, ready to leverage AI for business value and innovation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-block usp-block">
                    <h3>Unique Selling Proposition: Analytics That Pay</h3>
                    <p><strong>"Analytics That Pay: Business Problem-Solvers With AI Advantage"</strong></p>
                    <p>This program creates analytics-savvy business graduates who can immediately add value in any company through AI implementation. While traditional business students learn theories, our students master practical analytics skills that translate directly to potentially higher starting salaries and faster promotions. They'll develop the rare ability to connect business challenges with data-driven AI solutionsâ€”becoming the go-between that every organization desperately needs but struggles to find. Graduates are able to consistently outperform traditional business majors in the job market because of their immediately applicable analytics and AI capabilities.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>Market Need & Strategic Fit</h3>
                    <p>The modern business landscape demands professionals who not only understand data but can also harness the power of Artificial Intelligence. There is a clear and growing market gap for individuals skilled in both foundational business analytics and the practical application of AI tools. This BS-BAIA program directly addresses this need, positioning the NYIT School of Management as a forward-thinking leader in business education and aligning with strategic goals to produce graduates equipped for the future of work.</p>

                 <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>Core Philosophy: Applied AI for Business</h3>
                    <p>The program focuses on developing sophisticated *users*, *evaluators*, and *implementers* of AI within a business context, rather than training AI engineers. The curriculum emphasizes practical application, ethical considerations, and strategic deployment of AI to solve real-world business problems, building upon a strong, marketable foundation in traditional business analytics.</p>
